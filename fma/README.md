[paper]:     https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01840
[FMA]:       https://freemusicarchive.org

The dataset is a dump of the [Free Music Archive (FMA)][FMA], an interactive
library of high-quality, legal audio downloads. Below the abstract from the
[paper].
> We introduce the Free Music Archive (FMA), an open and easily accessible
> dataset suitable for evaluating several tasks in MIR, a field concerned with
> browsing, searching, and organizing large music collections. The community's
> growing interest in feature and end-to-end learning is however restrained by
> the limited availability of large audio datasets. The FMA aims to overcome
> this hurdle by providing 917 GiB and 343 days of Creative Commons-licensed
> audio from 106,574 tracks from 16,341 artists and 14,854 albums, arranged in
> a hierarchical taxonomy of 161 genres. It provides full-length and
> high-quality audio, pre-computed features, together with track- and
> user-level metadata, tags, and free-form text such as biographies. We here
> describe the dataset and how it was created, propose a train/validation/test
> split and three subsets, discuss some suitable MIR tasks, and evaluate some
> baselines for genre recognition. Code, data, and usage examples are available
> at <https://github.com/mdeff/fma>.

This is a **pre-publication release**. As such, this repository as well as the
paper and data are subject to change. Stay tuned!

## Data

All metadata and features for all tracks are distributed in
**[fma_metadata.zip]** (342 MiB). The below tables can be used with [pandas] or
any other data analysis tool. See the [paper] or the [usage] notebook for
a description.
* `tracks.csv`: per track metadata such as ID, title, artist, genres, tags and
  play counts, for all 106,574 tracks.
* `genres.csv`: all 163 genre IDs with their name and parent (used to infer the
  genre hierarchy and top-level genres).
* `features.csv`: common features extracted with [librosa].
* `echonest.csv`: audio features provided by [Echonest] (now [Spotify]) for
  a subset of 13,129 tracks.

[librosa]:  https://librosa.github.io/librosa/

Then, you got various sizes of MP3-encoded audio data:

1. **[fma_small.zip]**: 8,000 tracks of 30s, 8 balanced genres (GTZAN-like) (7.2 GiB)
2. **[fma_medium.zip]**: 25,000 tracks of 30s, 16 unbalanced genres (22 GiB)
3. **[fma_large.zip]**: 106,574 tracks of 30s, 161 unbalanced genres (93 GiB)
4. **[fma_full.zip]**: 106,574 untrimmed tracks, 161 unbalanced genres (879 GiB)

## Code

The following notebooks and scripts, stored in this repository, have been
developed for the dataset.

1. [usage]: shows how to load the datasets and develop, train and test your own
   models with it.
2. [analysis]: exploration of the metadata, data and features.
3. [baselines]: baseline models for genre recognition, both from audio and
   features.
4. [features]: features extraction from the audio (used to create
   `features.csv`).
5. [webapi]: query the web API of the [FMA]. Can be used to update the dataset.
6. [creation]: creation of the dataset (used to create `tracks.csv` and
   `genres.csv`).

## Usage

1. Download some data, verify its integrity, and uncompress the archives.
	```sh
	curl -O https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_metadata.zip
	curl -O https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_small.zip
	curl -O https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_medium.zip
	curl -O https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_large.zip
	curl -O https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_full.zip

	echo "f0df49ffe5f2a6008d7dc83c6915b31835dfe733  fma_metadata.zip" | sha1sum -c -
	echo "ade154f733639d52e35e32f5593efe5be76c6d70  fma_small.zip"    | sha1sum -c -
	echo "c67b69ea232021025fca9231fc1c7c1a063ab50b  fma_medium.zip"   | sha1sum -c -
	echo "497109f4dd721066b5ce5e5f250ec604dc78939e  fma_large.zip"    | sha1sum -c -
	echo "0f0ace23fbe9ba30ecb7e95f763e435ea802b8ab  fma_full.zip"     | sha1sum -c -

	unzip fma_metadata.zip
	unzip fma_small.zip
	unzip fma_medium.zip
	unzip fma_large.zip
	unzip fma_full.zip
	```

	If you get any error while decompressing the archives (especially with the
	Windows and macOS system unzippers), please try [7zip]. That is probably an
	[unsupported compression issue](https://github.com/mdeff/fma/issues/5).

2. Optionally, use [pyenv] to install Python 3.6 and create a [virtual
   environment][pyenv-virt].
	```sh
	pyenv install 3.6.0
	pyenv virtualenv 3.6.0 fma
	pyenv activate fma
	```

3. Clone the repository.
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/mdeff/fma.git
	cd fma
	```

4. Install the Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`. Depending on your
   usage, you may need to install [ffmpeg] or [graphviz]. Install [CUDA] if you
   want to train neural networks on GPUs (see
   [Tensorflow's instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)).
	```sh
	make install
	```

5. Fill in the configuration.
	```sh
	cat .env
	AUDIO_DIR=/path/to/audio
	FMA_KEY=IFIUSETHEAPI
	```

6. Open Jupyter or run a notebook.
	```sh
	jupyter-notebook
	make baselines.ipynb
	```
